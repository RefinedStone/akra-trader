# Current State

Canonical status snapshot for the repository as of April 21, 2026.

Use this document as the source of truth for what is actually implemented. Forward-looking planning
lives under [Roadmap](../roadmap/README.md) and [Blueprint](../blueprint/README.md).

## Product Position

`akra-trader` is currently best described as a single-operator research and runtime control
workstation for crypto-first strategy development.

It is no longer only a backtest demo:

- durable research runs, comparison, presets, and reruns are already present
- sandbox worker sessions exist with heartbeat and restart recovery semantics
- guarded-live control surfaces exist with kill switch, reconciliation, recovery, and venue-backed
  launch gates
- operator visibility includes incidents, delivery history, and audit-oriented surfaces

It is not yet a finished live trading product:

- custom strategy registration is still process-local
- experiment storage remains payload-centric in key paths
- control-room UX now has route-aware shell boundaries, but feature logic is still too monolithic
- guarded-live venue lifecycle handling is real but not complete
- LLM research infrastructure remains an interface skeleton

## Stage Read

- Stage 0: complete
- Stage 1 Research Foundation: largely complete
- Stage 2 Experiment OS: materially underway
- Stage 3 Runtime Ops: partially complete with real worker semantics
- Stage 4 Guarded Live: early but real control-plane coverage
- Stage 5 Intelligence Research: contract only

## Implemented Now

### Research core

- FastAPI backend with explicit domain, application, adapter, and runtime boundaries
- split port contracts under `port_contracts/*` with `ports.py` kept as a compatibility shim
- shared application fallback adapters and comparison policy moved into `application_support/*`
- run-surface enforcement and run serialization helpers moved into `application_support/run_surfaces.py`
- standalone surface/runtime query types plus filter/sort helpers moved into
  `application_support/runtime_queries.py`
- standalone surface binding catalogs moved into
  `application_support/standalone_surface_catalog.py`
- standalone surface execution, query-discovery serialization, and run-subresource binding helpers
  moved into `application_support/standalone_surfaces.py`
- durable run storage through `SqlAlchemyRunRepository`
- repo-local SQLite defaults with configurable Postgres support
- native backtest execution with persisted config, metrics, orders, fills, positions, notes, equity,
  and provenance
- native market-data lineage with dataset identity fingerprints, sync-checkpoint links, and rerun
  boundaries
- reference-runtime delegation for NostalgiaForInfinity backtests with stored benchmark provenance

### Experiment OS baseline

- run history listing and filtering by mode, strategy, version, and rerun-boundary identity
- native vs reference comparison API and control-room comparison workflow
- experiment presets with lifecycle actions, revisions, and restore flows
- typed query/filter contracts for strategies, presets, runs, and comparison surfaces
- shared query-discovery and run-surface capability contracts for typed query builders and run
  subresource actions
- strategy semantic metadata and parameter-contract hints propagated from catalog records into run
  snapshot and provenance views
- replay-link alias governance, audit browsing, and export-job utilities for query-builder surfaces
- native, sandbox, and paper reruns from stored rerun boundaries with match-or-drift tracking

### Runtime ops baseline

- sandbox worker sessions that continue processing newly arrived candles after a priming window
- persisted sandbox heartbeat cadence, processed-candle progress, and recovery history
- separate paper-session mode instead of collapsing paper into sandbox history
- market-data sync for ccxt-backed Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken with gap detection, lag reporting,
  sync checkpoints, backfill status, and failure history
- operator visibility for stale sandbox workers, worker failures, and recent runtime audit events

### Guarded-live baseline

- guarded-live kill switch, reconciliation, recovery, and resume control surfaces
- gated live launch behind configuration, reconciliation, and recovery checks
- venue-backed live order submission plus persisted live run history
- tracked live order lifecycle sync back into local orders, fills, positions, and audit notes
- operator cancel and replace actions for active live orders
- persisted live-session ownership and durable open-order snapshots
- venue-session handoff and continuation baseline for Binance, with supported continuation paths for
  Coinbase Advanced Trade and Kraken public market transport
- guarded-live incidents, delivery attempts, acknowledgment, escalation, remediation state, and
  provider workflow sync
- incident-delivery alias normalization and provider dispatch now flow through an explicit registry
  layer instead of only large condition chains
- the highest-traffic provider family methods for PagerDuty, Opsgenie, incident.io, FireHydrant,
  and Rootly now live in `adapters/operator_delivery_core_providers.py`

### Control room baseline

- route-aware React control-room shell with dedicated workspace routing metadata and shell layout
  modules under `apps/web/src/app/*`
- workspace-level panel grouping now lives under `apps/web/src/routes/*`
- shared control-room type/constant definitions now live in `apps/web/src/controlRoomDefinitions.ts`
- shared control-room transport helpers now live in `apps/web/src/controlRoomApi.ts`
- run-surface capability and comparison-boundary helpers now live in
  `apps/web/src/runSurfaceCapabilities.tsx`
- query-builder feature logic now lives under `apps/web/src/features/query-builder/*`
- dense feature content is still mostly in one large control-room file, but shell/routing concerns,
  route-level panel selection, run-surface capability helpers, and query-builder rendering are no
  longer defined inline with the remaining control-room body
- separate histories for backtest, sandbox, paper, and live modes
- guarded-live panels for candidacy blockers, venue snapshots, recovery state, and audit history
- operator surfaces for replay-link alias governance and audit export administration

## Partial Or Fragile Areas

- custom strategy registration exists, but registration metadata is still process-local rather than a
  durable strategy registry
- run storage is durable, but experiment querying and artifact retrieval still lean too heavily on
  payload-centric persistence
- the control room now has route and shell boundaries, but workspace feature modules still need to
  be extracted out of `App.tsx`
- the top-level control-room file no longer owns its full type/constant, API helper, run-surface
  helper, or query-builder context, but it still owns too much feature-local state and dense
  rendering logic
- standalone surface binding catalogs are isolated from the executor now, but the catalog module is
  still broad and should split further by bounded flow
- sandbox workers exist, but recent decisions, lag interpretation, and active-session-first operator
  workflows are still weaker than the underlying backend capabilities
- `application.py` and `operator_delivery.py` are smaller and more structured than before, but both
  still need further decomposition into dedicated use-case and provider modules
- `operator_delivery.py` no longer owns the full hot-path provider family end to end, but the
  remaining long-tail provider bodies still need the same treatment
- guarded-live recovery restores meaningful control-plane and order-lifecycle state, but it does not
  yet resume a full venue-native session lifecycle in all cases
- incident delivery and provider sync are broad, but provider-owned policy management and external
  incident ownership remain incomplete
- deployment guidance, backups, secret governance, and runbooks are not yet product-grade
- the LLM lane still stops at `DecisionEnginePort`, template strategy shapes, and trace-capable
  envelopes

## Not Implemented Yet

- durable custom strategy registration lifecycle and promotion workflow
- normalized experiment storage for common query, artifact, and export paths
- full venue-native amend flows and broader live order lifecycle management
- complete restart recovery for venue-native live session lifecycles
- operator-grade deployment/runbook package
- prompt versioning, raw trace persistence, replay harness, and fallback/review controls for LLM
  decision research
- multi-user workflows, RBAC, and organization features

## Immediate Next Priorities

1. Harden deterministic research claims around dataset identity, rerun validation, and lineage gaps.
2. Finish the Experiment OS around durable strategy lifecycle, normalized experiment queries, and
   artifact/export posture.
3. Productize the control room around active-session operations, clearer operator workflows, and
   decomposed UI surfaces.
4. Complete guarded-live safety around fuller venue lifecycle handling, runbooks, and deployment
   discipline.
5. Keep the LLM lane isolated until trace, replay, and fallback infrastructure are real features.
